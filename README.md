# Starwars Browser

This is the client for the Starwars Browser webapp.  
The reason this app exists is because I am currently exploring the .NET framework. I got to play around a bit with http requests and asynchonous methods in .NET and C# because the backend is connected to the SWAPI (Star Wars API).
